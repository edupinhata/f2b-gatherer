Author: Eduardo Pinhata

This is the first sketch before the program had being designed. 

This version simple read the fail2ban.log and perceive updates by the change of the number of lines that the log has.
The new lines are saved into a file in the same computer that the server is running.

There is no server control, neither the server can deal by itself with log erasing.
